# Desired Functionalities in Current Applications:
- Concise Visual Design: Prioritize the essentials through a clean interface and language, rather than nested dropdowns or long scrolling sessions. This allows users to quickly access information with minimal interactions
  
- Overview of Academic Information: Focus on knowing deadlines to room numbers with two-clicks rather than searching through their calendar or in-depth school system
  
- Design for Mobile Users: Large buttons to quick interactions enables any user to access information in any environment
  
- Quick Messaging System: Similar to texting a friend, ask classmates and professors questions quickly through an in-app messaging feature
  
- Consistent Design Throughout: Quick access to one's Course List, Account Information and a hyperlink to online documentation is always available with one click -- allowing users to access information faster
